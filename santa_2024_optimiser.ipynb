    "        Welcome to the <strong>Perplexity Permutation Puzzle</strong>, a unique challenge that combines the art of language with the science of optimization. In this competition, we are tasked with rearranging scrambled holiday-themed text sequences to minimize perplexity—a measure of how well a language model predicts the sequence. The goal is to transform chaotic word arrangements into coherent, meaningful passages that delight readers and showcase the power of natural language processing (NLP) and optimization techniques.\n",
